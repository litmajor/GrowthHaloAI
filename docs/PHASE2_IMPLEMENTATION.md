# Phase 2 Implementation Guide
## Associative Recall & Contradiction Detection

**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Timeline**: Months 4-6  
**Completion Date**: January 2025

---

## Overview

Phase 2 introduces advanced cognitive features that enable Bliss to:
1. **Surface relevant past insights** through multi-pathway memory recall
2. **Gently point out contradictions** between beliefs and actions
3. **Identify cognitive distortions** and offer reframes

---

## Architecture

### Database Schema

#### Beliefs Table
Tracks user's stated values, goals, intentions, and identity beliefs.

```typescript
- id: Primary key
- userId: Foreign key to users
- statement: The belief text
- category: value | goal | identity | preference | intention
- confidence: 0-1 score (increases with repeated mentions)
- firstStated: When first detected
- lastConfirmed: Last time belief was reaffirmed
- contradictingActions: Array of contradicting statements
- embedding: Vector embedding for semantic search
```

#### Contradictions Table
Records when actions contradict stated beliefs.

```typescript
- id: Primary key
- userId: Foreign key to users
- beliefId: Reference to contradicted belief
- contradictingStatement: The conflicting message
- contradictionType: action-value | goal-behavior | identity-action | cognitive-distortion
- severity: low | medium | high
- mentioned: Whether Bliss has addressed this
- userReaction: User's response (positive | neutral | negative)
```

#### Cognitive Distortions Table
Tracks thought patterns that may be unhelpful.

```typescript
- distortionType: all-or-nothing, catastrophizing, etc.
- evidence: The specific phrase exhibiting distortion
- alternativePerspective: Gentler reframe
```

#### Recalled Memories Table
Analytics on which memories are surfaced and why.

```typescript
- recallTypes: ['semantic', 'temporal', 'emotional', 'thematic', 'phase']
- relevanceScore: Computed relevance
- wasUsed: Whether memory was referenced in response
```

## Services

### 1. Associative Recall Service

**Multi-Pathway Memory Retrieval**

The system finds relevant memories through five different pathways:

1. **Semantic Similarity**: Vector embeddings find conceptually related memories
2. **Temporal Patterns**: Memories from similar times (hour of day, day of week)
3. **Emotional Resonance**: Memories with similar emotional states
4. **Thematic Overlap**: Shared topics/themes
5. **Growth Phase Alignment**: Memories from same growth phase

**Ranking Algorithm**:
- Memories found through multiple pathways get boosted scores
- Recency decay factor prevents overweighting old memories
- Top 3 most relevant memories included in Bliss context

**Example**:
```
User: "I'm thinking about quitting my job."

Recalls:
1. [Semantic + Thematic] 3 months ago about career fulfillment
2. [Emotional] 2 months ago expressing similar frustration
3. [Phase] 1 month ago during contraction phase discussing values
```

### 2. Contradiction Detection Service

**Belief Extraction**

Uses GPT-4 to identify statements like:
- "I want to be more vulnerable" (intention)
- "Authenticity matters to me" (value)
- "I'm not creative" (identity belief)

**Contradiction Detection**

Compares new messages against established beliefs (confidence > 0.6):

- **Action-Value**: "Family is important" → "Too busy for family dinner again"
- **Goal-Behavior**: "Want to set boundaries" → "Said yes to another request I didn't want"
- **Identity-Action**: "I'm an introvert" → "Signed up for 5 social events this week"

**Safety Mechanisms**:
- Max 2 contradictions mentioned per week
- Skip low-severity contradictions
- Don't mention if user is emotionally vulnerable
- Require pattern (2+ occurrences) before mentioning

**Gentle Delivery**:
```
"I'm noticing something... You've shared that [belief], but [contradicting action]. 
I'm curious about that gap—what do you think is making it hard to align?"
```

### 3. Cognitive Distortion Detection

Identifies 10 common patterns:
- All-or-nothing thinking
- Overgeneralization
- Catastrophizing
- Emotional reasoning
- Should statements
- Labeling
- Personalization
- Mental filter
- Discounting positives
- Jumping to conclusions

**Example**:
```
User: "I always mess everything up. I'm such a failure."

Detection: All-or-nothing + labeling
Reframe: "I hear you're being really hard on yourself. Words like 'always' 
and calling yourself a 'failure' make things feel more absolute than they are. 
What specifically happened that you're disappointed about?"
```

## Integration Points

### Chat Endpoint Enhancement

```typescript
1. Extract beliefs from user message
2. Run associative recall (5 pathways)
3. Detect contradictions against known beliefs
4. Detect cognitive distortions
5. Build enhanced context for GPT-4
6. Stream response with natural integration
```

### API Endpoints

```
GET /api/beliefs - User's tracked beliefs
GET /api/contradictions - Contradiction history
GET /api/cognitive-distortions - Distortion patterns
```

## User Experience

### Associative Recall

**Before Phase 2**:
```
User: I'm thinking about quitting my job.
Bliss: That's a big decision. What's making you consider this?
```

**After Phase 2**:
```
User: I'm thinking about quitting my job.
Bliss: That's a significant decision. I remember three months ago you 
were feeling similarly frustrated—you mentioned feeling unfulfilled and 
wanting more creative freedom. You were exploring freelance design work 
at the time. Is this feeling similar, or has something new shifted for you?
```

### Contradiction Detection

**Example Flow**:
```
Week 1: "I really want to be more authentic and vulnerable with people."
Week 3: "I went to that party and just put on my happy face. Didn't want 
        to burden anyone."

Bliss: "I'm noticing something... Two weeks ago you shared such a beautiful 
intention about being more vulnerable. But when you describe the party, it 
sounds like you did the opposite. I'm not judging—I'm curious: what made 
it hard to show up authentically? What were you protecting yourself from?"
```
