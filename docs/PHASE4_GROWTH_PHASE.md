# Phase 4.4: Growth Phase Prediction & Guidance

## Overview
Growth Phase Prediction helps users understand their current phase in the Growth Halo cycle (Expansion, Contraction, Renewal), predicts upcoming transitions, and provides phase-specific guidance.

## Features

### 1. Phase Detection
- Analyzes emotional patterns and conversation themes
- Identifies current phase with confidence scoring
- Provides evidence for phase determination

### 2. Transition Prediction
- Predicts next phase based on personal patterns
- Estimates timing of phase transitions
- Identifies early warning signals

### 3. Personal Pattern Recognition
- Extracts unique growth rhythms from history
- Shows how phases typically unfold for the user
- Reveals catalysts and triggers

### 4. Phase-Specific Guidance
- Provides contextual advice based on phase and progress
- Normalizes the experience of each phase
- Suggests preparation strategies

## The Three Phases

### Expansion Phase
- Characteristics: High energy, external focus, trying new things
- Purpose: Growth, exploration, building
- Duration: Typically 6-12 weeks
- Guidance: Embrace opportunities, but watch for overextension

### Contraction Phase
- Characteristics: Pulling back, questioning, internal focus
- Purpose: Integration, release, clarification
- Duration: Typically 4-8 weeks
- Guidance: Trust the process, let go without guilt

### Renewal Phase
- Characteristics: Clarity emerging, balanced energy, new direction
- Purpose: Preparation, intention-setting, grounded optimism
- Duration: Typically 3-6 weeks
- Guidance: Set intentions, prepare for wiser expansion

## Response Structure

```typescript
{
  currentPhase: "expansion" | "contraction" | "renewal",
  phaseProgress: 0.65, // 0-1
  confidence: 0.85,
  evidence: ["High energy in recent conversations", "Trying multiple new projects"],
  predictedTransition: {
    nextPhase: "contraction",
    estimatedTiming: "2-3 weeks",
    earlySignals: ["Feeling tired or overwhelmed", "Questioning commitments"],
    preparationSuggestions: ["Start identifying what to keep vs. release"]
  },
  phaseHistory: [...],
  personalPatterns: [
    "Your Contraction phases typically last 6-8 weeks",

## UI Components

**GrowthPhaseCompass** - Main visualization showing:
- Visual phase indicator with progress ring
- Current phase guidance
- Evidence for phase detection
- Predicted transition timeline
- Early warning signals
- Personal growth patterns
- Phase history

## Usage Examples

### Normalizing Contraction
When user feels they're "failing" during Contraction phase, the system can show:
- This is their 3rd Contraction phase
- Each lasted ~6 weeks
- Each led to important breakthroughs
- They're currently 65% through, historically this is the hardest part

### Preparing for Transition
When phase transition is approaching:
- Show early warning signals to watch for
- Provide specific preparation suggestions
- Reference past successful transitions
- Set expectations for what's ahead

## Implementation Notes

- Phase detection uses AI analysis of emotional data and conversation themes
- Personal patterns emerge after 3+ complete phase cycles
- Average phase durations calculated from user's history
- Guidance adapts to both phase and progress within phase

## Next Steps

- Integrate phase awareness into chat responses
- Add phase-specific prompts and suggestions
- Build phase transition celebrations
- Create phase journal prompts
- Track phase transition accuracy over time
