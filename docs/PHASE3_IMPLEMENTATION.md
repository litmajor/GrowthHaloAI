# Phase 3 Implementation Guide
## Causal Reasoning & Hypothesis Formation

**Status**: ðŸš§ In Progress  
**Timeline**: Months 7-10  
**Started**: January 2025

---

## Overview

Phase 3 introduces advanced causal reasoning capabilities that enable Bliss to:
1. **Identify cause-and-effect relationships** in user's life patterns
2. **Suggest actions based on past successes** 
3. **Find cross-domain analogies** to transfer solutions between life areas

---

## Architecture

### Database Schema

#### Causal Relationships Table
Tracks identified cause-and-effect patterns.

```typescript
- id: Primary key
- userId: Foreign key to users
- cause: The action/condition
- effect: The result/outcome
- confidence: 0-1 score (increases with observations)
- domain: work | relationships | health | creativity | wellbeing
- evidence: Array of conversation IDs
- firstObserved: When first detected
- lastConfirmed: Last time pattern was reaffirmed
- observationCount: Number of times observed
- contextFactors: Conditions under which pattern holds
```

#### Outcome Analyses Table
Records situations, approaches, and outcomes.

```typescript
- id: Primary key
- userId: Foreign key to users
- situation: Description of the situation
- approach: What the user did
- outcome: What happened
- outcomeQuality: positive | negative | mixed | neutral
- contributingFactors: Other factors involved
- timestamp: When it occurred
- growthPhase: User's phase at the time
- domain: Life area category
```

#### Domain Analogies Table
Stores cross-domain pattern transfers.

```typescript
- id: Primary key
- userId: Foreign key to users
- sourceId: Reference to original outcome
- sourceDomain: Original life area
- sourceSituation: Original situation
- sourceSolution: What worked
- targetDomain: New life area
- targetSituation: Current challenge
- analogyStrength: 0-1 similarity score
- transferability: 0-1 applicability score
- reasoning: Why they're similar
```

## Services

### Causal Reasoning Service

**Pattern Extraction**
- Analyzes conversations for cause-and-effect statements
- Builds confidence through repeated observations
- Requires 2+ observations before considering confirmed

**Action Suggestions**
- Finds past successes similar to current situation
- Recommends approaches that worked before
- Provides reasoning and confidence scores

**Analogical Thinking**
- Identifies structural similarities across domains
- Transfers solutions from one life area to another
- Example: Wedding planning strategies â†’ Project management

## User Experience

### Pattern Discovery
Users can view their causal patterns at `/patterns`:
- "When you X, you tend to Y"
- Confidence levels and observation counts
- Categorized by life domain

### Smart Suggestions
Bliss can proactively suggest actions:
```
"I've noticed a pattern: When you prepare presentations 2-3 days in advance 
and do a practice run, you feel more confident and they go better. Maybe 
try that for tomorrow's presentation?"
```

### Cross-Domain Wisdom
```
"This work challenge reminds me of how you handled wedding planningâ€”you 
created a 'non-negotiables' list and stayed flexible on everything else. 
Could that work here?"
```

## Integration Points

### Chat Enhancement
- Extract causal relationships from every conversation
- Detect when user describes outcomes
- Offer relevant past patterns when appropriate

### API Endpoints
```
GET /api/causal-patterns/:userId - Get user's patterns
POST /api/causal-patterns/suggest-actions - Get action suggestions
GET /api/causal-patterns/analogies/:userId - Find cross-domain wisdom
```
