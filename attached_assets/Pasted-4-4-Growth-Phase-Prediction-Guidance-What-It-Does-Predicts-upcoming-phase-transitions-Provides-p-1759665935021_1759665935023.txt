4.4 Growth Phase Prediction & Guidance
What It Does:

Predicts upcoming phase transitions
Provides phase-specific guidance
Normalizes the experience of each phase

Implementation:

Example Conversation:
User: "I feel like I'm failing. I've been so tired lately and can't seem to 
get excited about anything. I used to have so much energy."

Bliss: "Let me share something important with you. Looking at your growth 
patterns, you're not failing—you're transitioning.

**Your Growth Compass:**

You're in the **Contraction phase**, about 65% through it.

This is the third time I've watched you go through this cycle, and there's a 
beautiful pattern:

**Your Pattern:**
- Your Contraction phases always follow 8-10 weeks of intense Expansion
- You typically need 6-8 weeks of Contraction to integrate and clarify
- Around week 5-6 (you're in week 5 now), you feel the most lost
- But by week 7, clarity starts emerging like dawn

**What's Actually Happening:**
You're not losing energy—you're redirecting it inward. Last time this happened 
(January), you felt exactly like this. You said "I don't know what I'm doing 
anymore." Three weeks later, you had your breakthrough about leaving that toxic 
team environment.

The time before (September), you felt "stuck and purposeless." A month later, 
you started the creative project that brought you so much joy.

**Early Signals of Your Next Phase:**
I'm watching for these signs that Renewal is approaching:
- Small moments of clarity about what matters
- Feeling slightly more rested even if you're not doing more
- Gentle curiosity returning (not forced excitement)
- Dreams or ideas that feel quiet but compelling

**How to Work With This Phase:**
✓ Release the guilt about low energy—it's doing necessary work
✓ Journal when small insights emerge (they're planting seeds)
✓ Resist the urge to force yourself back into Expansion
✓ Trust that clarity is forming even in the fog

You're not stuck. You're in the cocoon. And based on your pattern, you're 
about 2-3 weeks from breakthrough.

Can you trust that?"

4.5 Wisdom Library (Synthesized Insights Repository)
What It Does:

Collects and organizes user's hard-won wisdom
Makes personal insights searchable and retrievable
Creates a living document of their growth

Schema:

  sourceConversationId: string;
  contextWhenLearned: string;

Example Usage in Conversation:
User: "I don't know if I should confront my coworker about this or just let it go."

Bliss: "This reminds me of your own wisdom. Let me share what you've learned 
about situations like this:

**From your Wisdom Library:**

📚 **On Conflict** (you realized this 4 months ago):
"I used to think avoiding conflict was keeping the peace, but I'm realizing 
it just turns the conflict inward. When I address things directly but kindly, 
I actually feel more peaceful afterward, even if the conversation is hard."

📚 **On Boundaries** (you realized this 7 months ago):
"My resentment is always a sign that I need to speak up. Waiting doesn't make 
it easier; it just makes me more bitter."

📚 **On Relationships** (you realized this 3 months ago):
"People can't read my mind. When I assume they know they hurt me and they're 
just not caring, I'm usually wrong. Most people are just oblivious, not malicious."

You've referenced these insights 12 times in the past year. They seem to be 
core truths for you.

Based on YOUR wisdom, what feels right here?"
