Phase 3: Causal Reasoning & Hypothesis Formation (Months 7-10)
Goal
Help users understand cause-and-effect in their lives and build a model of their unique patterns.
3.1 Causal Reasoning Engine
What It Does:

Identifies what actions led to what outcomes
Helps users see patterns: "When you X, Y tends to happen"
Suggests what might work based on past success

Schema:
typescriptinterface CausalRelationship {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  cause: string;
  effect: string;
  confidence: number; // 0-1, based on evidence
  domain: 'work' | 'relationships' | 'health' | 'creativity' | 'wellbeing';
  evidence: string[]; // Conversation IDs where pattern observed
  firstObserved: Date;
  lastConfirmed: Date;
  observationCount: number;
  contextFactors?: string[]; // Conditions under which this holds true
}

interface OutcomeAnalysis {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  situation: string;
  approach: string;
  outcome: string;
  outcomeQuality: 'positive' | 'negative' | 'mixed' | 'neutral';
  contributingFactors: string[];
  timestamp: Date;
  growthPhase: string;
}
Detection Service:
typescript// server/services/causalReasoningService.ts

export class CausalReasoningService {
  // Extract causal relationships from conversation
  async extractCausalRelationships(
    userId: string,
    message: string
  ): Promise<CausalRelationship[]> {
    const analysis = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-4",
      messages: [{

        content: `Identify cause-and-effect relationships in this message.
        
        Look for patterns like:
        - "When I do X, Y happens"
        - "After I started X, I noticed Y"
        - "X helped me Y"
        - "X made me feel Y"
        - "Because of X, Y occurred"
        
        Return JSON array of relationships:
        {
          cause: string (the action/condition),

User-Facing Examples:
typescript// When user asks for advice
async function handleAdviceRequest(
  userId: string,
  situation: string
): Promise<string> {
  const patterns = await causalReasoningService.getPatterns(userId);
  const suggestions = await causalReasoningService.suggestActions(
    userId,
    situation,
    "positive resolution"
  );

  return `Based on what I've learned about you:

**Patterns I've noticed:**
${patterns.slice(0, 3).map(p => 
  `• When you ${p.cause}, you tend to ${p.effect} (I've seen this ${p.observationCount} times)`
).join('\n')}

**What might help here:**
${suggestions.slice(0, 2).map(s =>
  `• ${s.suggestedAction}\n  Why: ${s.reasoning}\n  Similar to: ${s.pastExample}`
).join('\n\n')}

These are based on what's worked for you before. What resonates?`;
}
Example Conversation:
User: "I'm stressed about this presentation tomorrow."

Bliss: "I've noticed a pattern with you and high-stakes presentations: 
When you prepare your outline days in advance but wait until the night 
before to rehearse, you usually feel anxious. But when you do a practice 
run 2-3 days before (like you did for that client pitch in August), you 
feel much more confident and the presentation goes better.

I also remember that taking a walk before big presentations helps you 
clear your head—you mentioned that worked really well for your team 
meeting last month.

Based on that, maybe:
1. Do a full practice run today (not tomorrow morning)
2. Take a walk tomorrow before the presentation

Does that feel right for this situation?"

3.2 Analogical Thinking (Cross-Domain Pattern Transfer)
What It Does:

Finds similar challenges across different life domains
Suggests solutions from one area that might work in another
"This career challenge is like that relationship issue you solved"

Implementation:
typescriptinterface DomainAnalogy {
  sourceId: string; // Original situation ID
  sourceDomain: string;
  sourceSituation: string;
  sourceSolution: string;
  targetDomain: string;
  targetSituation: string;
  analogyStrength: number; // 0-1
  transferability: number; // How well solution might transfer
  reasoning: string;
}

async function findAnalogies(
  userId: string,
  currentSituation: string,
  currentDomain: string
): Promise<DomainAnalogy[]> {
  // Get past solved problems from other domains
  const pastSolutions = await db.select()
    .from(outcomeAnalyses)
    .where(eq(outcomeAnalyses.userId, userId))
    .where(ne(outcomeAnalyses.domain, currentDomain))
    .where(eq(outcomeAnalyses.outcomeQuality, 'positive'));

  // Find structural similarities
  const analogyAnalysis = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4",
    messages: [{
      role: "system",
      content: `Find analogies between this current challenge and past 
      successes from other life domains.
      
      Current situation (${currentDomain}): ${currentSituation}
      
      Past successes from other domains:
      ${pastSolutions.map(s => `
        Domain: ${s.domain}
        Situation: ${s.situation}
        Solution: ${s.approach}
        Outcome: ${s.outcome}
      `).join('\n')}
      
      Look for structural similarities:
      - Similar relationship dynamics (power imbalance, collaboration, conflict)
      - Similar emotional challenges (fear, uncertainty, overwhelm)
      - Similar constraints (time, resources, support)
      - Similar goals (growth, connection, achievement)
      
      Return JSON array of top 3 analogies with:
      {
        sourceId: which past situation,
        analogyStrength: 0-1,
        transferability: 0-1,
        reasoning: why they're similar,
        adaptedSolution: how to apply the past solution here
      }`
    }]
  });

  return JSON.parse(analogyAnalysis.choices[0].message.content);
}
Example Usage:
User: "My new project at work feels overwhelming. Too many stakeholders 
with different opinions and I don't know how to manage them all."

Bliss: "This reminds me of something from a completely different part of 
your life: Remember when you were planning your wedding and had to balance 
what your parents wanted, what your partner wanted, and what you wanted? 
You felt similarly overwhelmed by competing needs.

What worked then was creating a 'non-negotiables' list—the 3 things that 
truly mattered to you—and being flexible on everything else. That helped 
you navigate those competing voices without losing yourself.

Could that approach work here? What are the 2-3 non-negotiables for this 
project that you need to protect, while being flexible on the rest?"
